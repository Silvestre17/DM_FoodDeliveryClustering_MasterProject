## **üìù Description**

This repository documents a comprehensive **Data Mining** project focused on ***ABCDEats Inc.***, a fictional food delivery service. We analyze a rich dataset of customer transactions and behaviors to develop a data-driven segmentation strategy. The goal is to empower ABCDEats to move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach and tailor its marketing, promotions, and service offerings to distinct customer profiles.

## **‚ú® Objective**

The primary objectives of this project are to:

1.  Conduct an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand customer behaviors, trends, and patterns.
2.  **Preprocess** the data, handling inconsistencies, missing values, outliers, and perform feature engineering/selection.
3.  Apply and evaluate various **Clustering Algorithms** (*Hierarchical*, *K-Means*, *SOM*, *Density-based*) from different perspectives (***Overall***, ***Value-based***, ***Behavior-based***).
4.  Develop a **Final Customer Segmentation** solution by comparing and potentially merging results from different approaches.
5.  **Profile** the resulting customer segments, highlighting their key characteristics.
6.  Suggest actionable **Business Applications** and marketing strategies for each segment.
7.  (Optional) Develop an interactive **Web Application** for exploring the EDA and segmentation results.

## üéì Project Context

This project was developed for the **Data Mining** course as part of the **[Master's in Data Science and Advanced Analytics](https://www.novaims.unl.pt/en/education/programs/postgraduate-programs-and-master-degree-programs/master-degree-program-in-data-science-and-advanced-analytics-with-a-specialization-in-data-science/)** program at **NOVA IMS**. The work was completed during the **1st Semester** of the 2024/2025 academic year.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries

The project was implemented entirely in **Python**, leveraging a powerful stack of libraries for data science, machine learning, and web deployment.

<br>

## **üèóÔ∏è Project Structure (CRISP-DM Phases)**

1.  **Business Understanding:** üí°
    *   Defined the core business problem: Need for effective customer segmentation for ***ABCDEats Inc.*** to personalize marketing and services.
    *   Established project objectives aligned with business goals (improve customer satisfaction, retention, revenue).

2.  **Data Understanding:** üîç
    *   Explored the initial dataset (31,888 customers, 56 features).
    *   Identified data types, distributions (skewness, kurtosis), and initial relationships (pair plots).
    *   Detected missing values (`customer_age`, `first_order`, `HR_0`), duplicates, and inconsistencies (`'-'` in `customer_region`, `last_promo`; illogical `vendor/product/order_counts`).

      <a href="https://www.matplotlib.org/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Matplotlib-D3D3D3?style=for-the-badge&logo=matplotlib&logoColor=white" alt="Matplotlib" /></a>
      <a href="https://www.seaborn.pydata.org/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Seaborn-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=seaborn&logoColor=white" alt="Seaborn" /></a>
    </p>

3.  **Data Preparation & Feature Engineering üõ†Ô∏è**
    *   **Cleaning:** Handled duplicates (removed 13), treated inconsistencies (removed 18 illogical rows, reinterpreted '-').
    *   **Missing Value Imputation:** Used deterministic logic (`first_order`, `HR_0`) and `KNNImputer` (`customer_age`).
    *   **Feature Engineering:** Created new features (e.g., `order_count`, `days_between_orders`, `customer_region_buckets`, `last_promo_bin`, CUI totals/averages/most spent, PCA components). Discarded less informative engineered features (e.g., CUI proportions).
    *   **Outlier Handling:** Applied a mixed strategy (modified IQR and manual removal based on boxplots/domain knowledge), retaining 98.61% of data.
    *   **Variable Selection:** Used Spearman correlation (threshold 0.8) to identify and remove redundant features (`vendor_count`, `product_count`, `days_between_orders`, `customer_age`, `customer_age_group`).
    *   **Feature Scaling:** Applied `StandardScaler` to numerical features for distance-based algorithms.
    *   **Dimensionality Reduction:** Used `PCA` separately on CUI and HR feature groups to reduce noise/redundancy while preserving variance (kept 7 CUI PCs, 4 HR PCs). Original DOW variables were retained.

    </p>

4.  **Modeling: Multi-Perspective Clustering üß†**
    *   Applied multiple clustering algorithms:
        *   Hierarchical Clustering (HC - Agglomerative, Ward linkage)
        *   K-Means
        *   Self-Organizing Maps (SOM - using `MiniSom`) + HC/K-Means
        *   Density-Based: Mean Shift, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
    *   Performed clustering on 'Overall', 'Value-based', and 'Behavior-based' feature subsets.

      <a href="https://github.com/JustGlowing/minisom"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/MiniSom-4CAF50?style=for-the-badge" alt="MiniSom"/></a>
    </p>

5.  **Evaluation & Final Segmentation ‚úÖ**
    *   Determined optimal cluster numbers using Elbow method (Inertia/SSE), Silhouette analysis, R¬≤ metric (for HC), AIC/BIC (for GMM), and visual inspection (dendrograms).
    *   Compared performance across algorithms and perspectives based on R¬≤ and silhouette scores.
    *   Selected best-performing methods for each perspective (SOM+K-Means overall, K-Means value, SOM+K-Means behavior).
    *   Manually merged the 'Value' (k=3) and 'Behavior' (k=4) solutions based on centroid analysis to create a final, more robust 5-cluster solution.
    *   Visualized cluster separation using t-SNE and UMAP.

6.  **Deployment üöÄ**
    *   **Profiling:** Characterized the final 5 clusters using descriptive statistics, bar plots, and heatmaps.
    *   **Business Applications:** Defined marketing strategies tailored to each segment.
    *   **(Optional) Interactive Dashboard:** Developed a web application using Streamlit and Plotly for dynamic exploration of EDA and segmentation results. [Access the App Here!](https://dm-project-abcdeats-group37.streamlit.app/)
